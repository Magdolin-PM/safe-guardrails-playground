## üì± What is This?

After seeing developers like Leo struggle with security issues in their AI-built SaaS projects, I created this educational tool to help non-technical "vibe coders" implement basic security guardrails before going public with their projects.

> "AI is no longer just an assistant, it's also the builder. Now, you can continue to whine about it or start building." - Leo

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple, Choice-Based Interface**: No technical expertise required
- **Project-Specific Recommendations**: Tailored guidance based on your specific use case
- **Interactive Learning**: See real examples of vulnerable vs. secure code
- **Actionable Security Checklists**: Practical steps anyone can implement
- **No Integration Required**: Pure educational guidance that works without any backend connection

## üîê Security Guardrails Covered

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Password hashing and secure storage
   - Authentication flow best practices
   - Session management recommendations

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - API key validation and management
   - Proper error handling

3. **Database Security**
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Parameterized queries
   - Database access pattern validation

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
   - Input sanitization techniques
   - Form validation best practices

5. **General Security Recommendations**
   - Project-specific best practices
   - Data handling requirements (PII, payment info)
   - Technology-specific security tips

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Select your project type (website, SaaS, API, etc.)
2. Choose the technologies you're using
3. Indicate what kinds of data you'll be handling
4. Explore security recommendations tailored to your choices
5. View specific code examples showing secure vs. insecure implementations
6. Use the practical guidance to implement proper guardrails in your project

## üí° Why It Matters

Vibe coders are using AI to build faster than ever, but security can't be an afterthought. This tool bridges the gap between rapid development and basic security practices, helping you avoid common pitfalls before your project goes public.

As Leo discovered when his project was compromised: "ever since I started to share how I built my SaaS using Cursor, random thing are happening, maxed out usage on api keys, people bypassing the subscription, creating random shit on db."

## üåü About the Creator

This project was created by [Magdolin Harmina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdolin-harmina-52139978/), Founder of [QL-Assistai.com](https://QL-Assistai.com) - a consultancy specializing in helping organizations implement AI solutions with proper safeguards.
